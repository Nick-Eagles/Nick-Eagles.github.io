## Bio

I'm currently a data scientist and bioinformatician in the
[team](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/) led by Leonardo
Collado-Torres at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/).

Here, I use R, Python, shell scripting, and more to develop computational
pipelines for processing genomic data, explore and implement machine-learning
methods, and publish research papers showcasing open-source software and biological
findings. My work in genomics spans topics such as bulk-RNA sequencing (for
which I published [SPEAQeasy](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04142-3)),
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (see
[BiocMAP](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.488947)), spatial transcriptomics
(see [visiumStitched](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-024-10991-y)), and
cell-type deconvolution.

I also help
[install and maintain software](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_mod_source)
for LIBD and collaborators, and mentor and share my knowledge through
[data science guidance sessions](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html)
and [R Stats Club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) presentations. Some example
topics I've taught include
[implementing machine-learning models in python](https://youtu.be/-qFz7PwWEeY),
[system-wide software installations on high-performance computing clusters with Lmod](https://youtu.be/8w6JDsrgqVs),
and [running PyTorch-based software with GPUs at HPC environments](https://youtu.be/zOMUXYHtVJM).
