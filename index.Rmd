## Bio

I'm currently a data scientist and bioinformatician in the
[team](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/) led by Leonardo
Collado-Torres at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/).

Here, I use R, Python, shell scripting, and more to develop computational
pipelines for processing genomic data, explore and implement machine-learning
methods, and publish research papers showcasing open-source software and biological
findings. My work in genomics spans topics such as bulk-RNA sequencing (for
which I published [SPEAQeasy](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04142-3)),
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (see
[BiocMAP](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.488947)), spatial transcriptomics
(see [visiumStitched](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-024-10991-y)), and
cell-type deconvolution.

I also help
[install and maintain software](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_mod_source)
for LIBD and collaborators, and mentor and share my knowledge through
[data science guidance sessions](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html)
and [R Stats Club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) presentations. Some example
topics I've taught include
[implementing machine-learning models in python](https://youtu.be/-qFz7PwWEeY),
[system-wide software installations on high-performance computing clusters with Lmod](https://youtu.be/8w6JDsrgqVs),
and [running PyTorch-based software with GPUs at HPC environments](https://youtu.be/zOMUXYHtVJM).

## Portfolio

### Data Science Snippets

Here I showcase actual code I've developed for data-science tasks throughout
my career.

- **Building machine-learning models**: [here](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/spatialDLPFC/blob/main/code/spot_deconvo/02-cellpose/10-explore_models.py)
I use `scikit-learn` to train and test some candidate cell-type-classification
models.

- **Data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization**: Beginning with several messy,
large datasets, I use `dplyr` in R to [clean and integrate them.](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Habenula_Pilot/blob/b7b670eafbd10093f94dafc62c787199d1fbd719/code/17_eQTL/08_beta_plots.R#L315-L374)
Along the way, I [visualize key patterns](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/Habenula_Pilot/blob/b7b670eafbd10093f94dafc62c787199d1fbd719/code/17_eQTL/08_beta_plots.R#L229-L246)
with `ggplot2`.

- **Deep learning**: In a personal project to build a neural-network-powered
chess engine, I use Keras/Tensorflow to [build and fit a CNN-based model.](https://github.com/Nick-Eagles/Chess-Engine/blob/master/external/fit_real_data.py)

### Data Engineering Projects

These personal projects are heavier on the SQL, ETL/ELT pipelining, and data-warehouse-interaction
side of things.

- **ELT pipeline + data warehouse**: [here](https://github.com/Nick-Eagles/customer_orders_ELT)
I designed a data warehouse using the medallion architecture, and implemented an
ELT pipeline using `dbt` and `Airflow` to populate it with cleaned, BI-ready
tables.

- **Titanic Databricks project**: [here](https://github.com/Nick-Eagles/data_engineering_practice/tree/master/databricks/titanic_project)
I engineer a Databricks workflow/ ETL pipeline with the well-known
Titanic dataset touching `Pyspark`, Databricks notebooks + dashboards, Unity Catalog,
and more. As a bonus I recreated the final visualizations with interactivity in Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nick.eagles/viz/TitanicDatasetKeyFindings/main_dashboard#1).

### Bioinformatics Pipelines

These are *Nextflow*-based pipelines for processing genomic data where I was the
lead developer.

- **SPEAQeasy**: bulk RNA-seq preprocessing workflow, quantifying features like
genes into `SummarizedExperiment` R objects (
[code](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/SPEAQeasy) |
[documentation](http://lieberinstitute.github.io/SPEAQeasy) |
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04142-3))

- **BiocMAP**: preprocessing workflow for bisulfite sequencing data, quantifying
methylation in `bsseq` R objects (
[code](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/BiocMAP) |
[documentation](http://research.libd.org/BiocMAP/) |
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.488947))
