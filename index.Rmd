## Bio

I'm currently a Research Associate in the [data science team](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/) led by Leonardo Collado-Torres at [LIBD](https://www.libd.org/).

Here, I use R, python, shell scripting, and more to develop computational pipelines for processing genomic data, explore and implement machine-learning methods, and publish research papers showcasing this software and biological findings. My work in genomics spans topics such as bulk-RNA-sequencing (for which I published [SPEAQeasy](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04142-3)), whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (for which I published [BiocMAP](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.20.488947)), spatial transcriptomics, and cell-type deconvolution.

I also help [install and maintain software](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/jhpce_mod_source) for LIBD and collaborators, and mentor and share my knowledge through [data science guidance sessions](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html) and [R Stats Club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/) presentations.
